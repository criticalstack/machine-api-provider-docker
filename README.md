# machine-api-provider-docker

This repository contains the Docker provider implementation for [Machine API](https://github.com/criticalstack/machine-api). It enables declarative management of Docker containers used as Kubernetes nodes. Unlike other providers, this provider is designed to develop and test Machine API locally (i.e. without accessing remote cloud provider resources).
